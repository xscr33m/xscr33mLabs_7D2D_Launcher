# xscr33mLabs 7Days2Die Launcher

A streamlined, user-friendly launcher designed for managing and connecting to a dedicated 7 Days to Die server. The launcher also supports automatic fetching and installation of server mods to ensure that all clients are up-to-date with the latest server configurations.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies the process of connecting to your 7 Days to Die server with an intuitive, easy-to-navigate UI.
- **Dark Mode**: Enjoy a sleek, dark-themed interface that reduces eye strain during extended use.
- **Automatic Updates**: The launcher checks for updates automatically, ensuring you always have the latest version with new features and improvements.
- **Mod Synchronization**: Automatically download and install the necessary server mods to keep your client in sync with the server.
- **Customizable**: Easily set up and save connection settings, including IP, port, and server password, for quick access.
- **Security**: Your data is stored securely, with options to show or hide sensitive information such as passwords.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/xscr33m/xscr33mLabs-7D2D-Launcher/releases) page and download the most recent version of the launcher.
2. **Extract and Run**: Unzip the downloaded file, navigate to the extracted folder, and run `xscr33mLabs-7D2D-Launcher.exe`.
3. **Configure Your Connection**: Enter your server's IP, port, and other details, or let the launcher automatically find the game path.
4. **Sync Mods**: Click this button to sync the servers mods to your client. (Currently only for my own server - this will be updated at some point)
5. **Join the Server**: Click the "Join" button to connect to your server.

## How to Use

- **Searching for the Game Folder**: The launcher can automatically detect the default installation paths for 7 Days to Die. If your installation is in a custom directory, use the "Browse" button to manually select the game executable.
